This mod is for players that wants to slow down overall progress of the game, so they have more time to fine-tune everything and enjoy watching the traffic 

[b]Features[/b]
[list]
[*] Slows the city's grow rate, so demands are more stable  
[*] Optionally slows down deposits depletion
[*] Optionally slows down a research rate (it use same amount of resources per day, but for longer time) 
[/list]

Is it safe to add and remove mod from the existing game.
